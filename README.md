<p><b>Research Dissertation Sentiment Analysis - Detection of Abusive Language on Social Networks using Machine Learning</b></p>

<b>Abstract</B>

The objective of this thesis is to create models that can identify abusive language in social media platforms such as Twitter Data Set and Detecting Insults
in Social Commentary. Two models were developed for this purpose, and both were trained and evaluated on Twitter data (Wassem and Hovy, 2016). Initially, 
we applied the Naïve Bayes model as it is the most commonly used technique in text classification and evaluation (Wei Zhang and Feng Geo, 2011). 
Subsequently, we used the RNN (Recurrent Neutral Networks), which is a more efficient method for text classification compared to Naïve Bayes
(Maaz Amaid, Zhanibek Kaimuldenov, Ilia Voronkov,2016). To test the accuracy and effectiveness of the models, we evaluated them on another dataset, i.e.,
Detecting Insults in Social Commentary. Finally, we analyzed and adjusted the results of the models accordingly.
