<b>Abstract</B>

The GitHub repository contains the research dissertation on "Sentiment Analysis - Detection of Abusive Language on Social Networks using Machine Learning." The main objective of this research is to create machine learning models that can detect abusive language on social media platforms, such as Twitter.

The research work developed two models, which were trained and evaluated using Twitter dataset, specifically Wassem and Hovy, 2016. Initially, the research employed the Naïve Bayes model as it is the most commonly used technique in text classification and evaluation. Later, the research utilized RNN (Recurrent Neutral Networks) as it is a more efficient method for text classification compared to Naïve Bayes, according to previous research studies.

To test the accuracy and effectiveness of the models, the research evaluated them on another dataset, i.e., Detecting Insults in Social Commentary. Finally, the research analyzed and adjusted the results of the models accordingly.

The repository contains the source code, data, and other resources used in the research. It provides insights into the development, training, and evaluation of machine learning models to identify abusive language on social media platforms. It can be useful for researchers, developers, and data scientists working on similar projects.
